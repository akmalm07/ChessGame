Welcome to my Chess Game!

In my Chess Game created using C++ and OpenGL, there is currently a critical bug related to the orientation of the chessboard. Specifically, the visual representation of the board buttons does not match the intended positional data of the squares. This results in mismatches where the mouse coordinates and button positions are not aligned with the actual chess squares, leading to incorrect identification of pieces and interactions. The challenge lies in correctly mapping the mouse and button positions to the appropriate squares, ensuring that when a button is clicked, the correct square on the board is referenced. Debugging this issue is a priority, as it affects core gameplay mechanics.

To build it, open premake5.lua and edit the rootDir variuble to your directory, and then open Scripts/run_premake5.bat and run it, and it will create a visual studio solution. Thanks for visiting!
